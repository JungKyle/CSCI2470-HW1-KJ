This readme describes the mnist and cifar KNN assignments.

I had a bit of rough beginning of the semester, so I am using 3/4 late days to submit this assignment. I am better now. I was not able to finish part of CIFAR assignment, which will be described later on in this document.

For the MNIST model, everything was implemented fully as instructed. The model classification accuracy was pretty high at 0.912 for k=9. There was one hiccup in the visualization part, but it was part of the stencil, so I did not mess with it. 

For the CIFAR model, I got the brunt of the work done. I did not have time to get subsets of the data set. As a proxy, I just sampled the first images of the full image set to complete the rest of the project. Everything else went smoothly. I got an accuracy of 0.232 for the regular image inputs to the KNN. The resnet input boosted the KNN accuracy to 0.58.
